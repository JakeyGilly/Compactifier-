# Compactifier
## About
This project is designed to compact code in Python (more languages coming soon)
There are 3 stages of compactness that Compacter can handle
* A bit compact (level 1)
* Compact (level 2)
* Annoyingly compact (level 3)

You can find out more about the stages [here](https://example.com)

## Usage
You can clone this repository using ```git clone https://github.com/JakeyGilly/Compactifier.git``` or grab a release from the releases tab.

Then you need to build the Compactifier from source code. (Doesn't apply if download release)

Next you execute the Compactifier with the file needed to compact and the compact level as the parameters using 
```
./Compactifier /path/to/file 1 (Linux/Mac)

Compactifier.exe /path/to/file 1 (Windows)
```
