# Compactifier
## About
This project is designed to compact code in Python (more languages coming soon)

This project was inteded to be made in The C Language but I decided to switch to C++ becuase it has more features and better support for Strings.

This project is still in development and I am working on it.

## Usage
You can clone this repository using ```git clone https://github.com/JakeyGilly/CompactifierPlusPLus.git``` or grab a release from the releases tab.

Build the project using ```make```.

Next you execute the Compactifier with the file needed to compact and the compact level as the parameters using 
```
./Compactifier.out /path/to/file 1 (Linux/Mac)

Compactifier.exe /path/to/file 1 (Windows)
```

## Future Todo
### Stages
There will be 3 stages of compactness that Compacter can handle
* A bit compact (level 1)
* Compact (level 2)
* Annoyingly compact (level 3)

You can find out more about the stages [here](http://github.com/JakeyGilly/CompactifierPlusPlus/blob/master/stages.md)

### Features
* Compact Formatting
* Debug Mode
